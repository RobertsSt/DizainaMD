						<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>uesday usually started with breakfast and tea at eight o'clock. Then I take a shower and brush my teeth. Today's special is that after work I have to go to the dance where I can for a moment disappear from all work and responsibilities and be only in that moment. At 10:30 I am at my first lecture, which is mathematical logic. This is the first math I don't like. I'm a mathematical person, so I chose this direction, and I've always liked mathematics, especially, which is challenging, because then I get the nasty joy of having many who don't understand the subject, but I can feel special about it that I understand. But this time the roles have changed.</p>

						<p>Usually I leave the class around 12:15pm and did not understood half of the taught and go to eat with a coursmate so I can go to work later. I am at work usually around 1pm. I enjoy being at work, having nice colleagues here and good coffee and a project I'm working on is interesting.</p>

						<p>I got this job thanks to Richard, a member of the corporation. We met at one of the corporate parties and when Richard realized that I love programming, he offered me a job at the place he works now. After a week of reflection, I accepted his job offer. When I program, I have the feeling that I have to solve mild math problems all the time, which gives me some fun in the unknown, for every little thing I solve.

						<p>At around 6pm I leave work and go home to get dressed for dancing. There must be a suit for dancing. At 19:00 the dancing starts and since I live next door I always enter exactly one minute before 7pm. Dancing always starts with inviting your girlfriend or partner to dance, who are separated at first, from the guys. I usually only meet my girl only when boys inviting the girls to dance, so it's usually a nice moment for us.

						<p>After the invitation, we usually dance the waltz so we can focus on the partners and not think too much about the dance steps. She then usually tells how she fared during the day, and are interested in me how my day went. This is usually the most enjoyable and stress free day of the week for me, despite the math, so I can mainly say to her that I was doing well and I always tell what was interesting to me during the day.

						<p>After 20 minutes, we start to fool around because my girlfriend and I didn't go to dance to learn, we just go there to spend time together and to be sure to meet once a week. We already know all these dances, so our favorite strangely activity is mocking. When we dance we always laugh and have a good time. After dancing, if we don't have to run somewhere, we nap for an hour, and then in the evening she goes home to study or sleep. When she goes home, I usually try to learn something and plan for tomorrow, or I usually go to bed quickly to get ready for tomorrow.
